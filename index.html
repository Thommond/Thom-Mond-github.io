        <h2 id='resume'>My Works</h2>

        <h4>Maze Game Deluxe</h4>

        <p>I have worked on a variety of projects, however I have enjoyed two the most. I worked with a JavaScript
        Maze Game in my first semester of college and it was difficult, but the hardwork paid off with a functioning video game.
        In Maze Game Deluxe you can play through 11 mazes that increase in difficulty as you go up. You are a little square mover
        that at all costs do not hit the wall and make it to the gold finish line. When you complete the game you get a cool wall
        paper. <a href="#">Check it out Maze Game on github</a>, or <a href="#">on the actual deployed site</a>.</p> <!-- TODO: Link to github -->

        <h4>TSCT-Portal</h4>

        <p>Thaddeus Stevens portal remake was the largest project of my freshman year at college it brought a great challenge, but
        the skill's gained like remote team work, git branch work flow, and my personal gain of being devops of the group. The challenge
        of the project was to recreate the <a href="#">Thaddeus Stevens College Portal</a> into our own version to learn how to develop
        Web Apps. <a href="#">Checkout out my groups portal recreation on github</a>, or <a href="#">the actual deployment of the project</a>.</p>

        then here is my <a href="#">general github profile</a>.</p>
