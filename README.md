# Thom-Mond-github.io

This is the `discontinued` programming professional website of Thomas M.

## Contents

I have a work section discussing what I learned and
my favorite coding skills. Which includes my coding projects
and my academic accomplishments. I also included a PDF download
iframe which holds my up to date resume.

Moreover, I have my interests section telling anyone interested
a bit more about me like hobbies, clubs and basic traits.

## Helpful hints

I have a few links for my Github and Deployed projects, as well
as my social links like linkedin and others. The best way to get
in contact with me is through email.
